# Sprint 2 Backlog

**Project:** Migrant Hub
**Sprint 2:** 3 September – 17 September 2026
**Goal:** Build the React frontend and the Express backend separately and agree the API
between them. Do not connect them.

---

## First — both teams together

| # | Task | Who | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Agree the API contract: endpoints, methods, request JSON, response JSON, field names and types | All five | 
| 2 | Decide that Must Do content comes from the backend, not hardcoded in the frontend | All five | 
| 3 | Commit the API contract to the repo so both teams work from the same file | Sajib |

Once this is done, the two teams can work without waiting for each other.

---

## Frontend — Sajib, Pratham, Prabhleen

Build in this order. If we run out of time, the last two are the ones we drop.

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Set up the React project and folder structure | |
| 2 | Build the navbar and footer as shared components | Used on every page |
| 3 | Set up routing so the navbar links change the page | |
| 4 | Homepage | Hero, search box, category chips, post cards |
| 5 | Blog list page | |
| 6 | Single post page | |
| 7 | Write a post form, with the live 512-word counter | |
| 8 | Must Do overview page | Six cards |
| 9 | Must Do detail page | One component, different content for DVV, police, bank, HSL, Tuudo, housing |
| 10 | Login page | Only shows "Login successful" — no real login |
| 11 | Register page | Only shows "Registration successful" |
| 12 | Mock data file, written in the same shape as the agreed API | |
| 13 | Community page | Drop this first if we run short |
| 14 | Search results page | Drop this second if we run short |

## Backend — Sehwinder, Yun

Posts first. It is the main thing our product does, and the other two are simpler versions
of the same pattern.

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Set up the Express server | |
| 2 | Set up the MVC folder structure | models, controllers, routes, middleware |
| 3 | Create mock/array data for posts | |
| 4 | Post model and data structure | |
| 5 | Post controller with create, read, update, delete | |
| 6 | Post routes | |
| 7 | Test post endpoints in Postman | |
| 8 | Must Do items - model, controller, routes | Same pattern as posts |
| 9 | Communities — model, controller, routes | |
| 10 | Error handling middleware | |
| 11 | Refactor from array data to MongoDB and Mongoose | After it is taught in class, week 4 |
| 12 | Test everything again in Postman after the refactor | |

## Process work — everyone

Easy to forget, and it is worth marks.

| # | Task | Who |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Run the Sprint 2 retrospective using the 4Ls format — Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for | Whole team |
| 2 | Run the Sprint Review and write down what we finished | Whole team |
| 3 | Each person: LLM self-assessment of their frontend code | Everyone |
| 4 | Each person: LLM self-assessment of their backend code | Everyone |
| 5 | Build the 10-12 minute presentation | Sehwinder |
